**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

You can ensure functionality and security through rigorous testing. When testing the goal in mind shouldn't be to see if everything works, the goal should be to find something that does not work. 
Aim to break the program and in the long run your programs will be more functional and secure as a result.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

When interpreting user needs, firstly, analyze the requirements of the program, design the program while staying aligned to the requirements, and finally perform rigorous testing to ensure that the requirements are met.
In the case of users, performing several use case tests will aid in ensuring that the user's needs are met.

**How do I approach designing software?**

I approach designing software by analyzing the requirements and sticking to them within reason. Sticking to requirements directly is not always the best choice, sometimes you need to read between the lines of the requirements to understand what the program needs to be successful.
For example, in this project the requirements do not outline the overloading of the equals function for the object classes, but overloading the equals function allows for more robust testing and a level of future proofing that support base requirements.
